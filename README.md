# University-Map

This is a simple example of using D3.JS to draw the continental U.S. (based on examples by Mike Bostock and others) and plot a red dot for each post-secondary education institution in the country.
Data on educational institutions (I believe this data encompasses community colleges, technical colleges, as well as traditional 4-year colleges and universities) came from: https://inventory.data.gov/dataset/032e19b4-5a90-41dc-83ff-6e4cd234f565/resource/38625c3d-5388-4c16-a30f-d105432553a4.

I want to:
- move the data to a database (likely MongoDB)
- add some more information about each school
- make data filterable
- perhaps join on some other interesting data sets that are relevant
